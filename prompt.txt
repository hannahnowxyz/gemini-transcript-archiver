Great! Please now create a simple HTML report that summarizes the key points and hurdles that you learned from this conversation. In particular, focus on the following stumbling blocks:
1. Garbage element removal
2. Page scrolling
3. User message width
4. Button positioning
5. Difficulties with complex selectors
6. Printing-specific challenges

This report will be supplied to future models, along with the finalized script, to help make changes as needed (for example, as Google's web UI design evolves). This is the full intended workflow:
1. While a Gemini Apps chat is open, a bookmarklet is initially used to remove elements like headers, sidebars, and the chatbox.
2. Next, the page is archived using the SingleFile open source browser extension.
3. Next, the HTML file will be finalized by the simplifier script.
